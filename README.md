# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
# 1. Problems and findings

## Problems
- Adding data to array from another components
- maintaining the state of the components when you add or delete new data
- 

## Findings
- React useEffect to handle data before data loads to the DOM and after it loads
- using Json Server to hold data to be used while fetching them like an API
- using Reach history to reload or push to a new route using the history prop
- handling and mastering use of the state and conditional rendering 
- 

# 2. Time Taken to Complete
 - its been 5 to 7 hours working on the project

# 3. Your coding style and standards
    the coding style is used was line coding and error control and 
    the standard of using safe ,secure and portable codes

# 4. Your source code files plus the final (e.g. compiled) result that can be opened directly in a browser

# 5. Documentation of your code where necessary

before running the project first initialize the project to get tailwindcss modules , using the steps below
 ## steps to follow 
 1. npx install
 2. npx run build-tailwind (to rebuild the css)
